Just stick the directory somewhere for now, edit rbotconf/conf.rbot and run
./rbot.rb.

You can maintain multiple configurations at once, start rbot with the
location you want it to store runtime data in. By default, running ./rbot.rb
uses the rbotconf subdirectory which contains a sample configuration. If you
run ./rbot.rb ~/.rbot, then the configuration will be stored and read from
there instead.
